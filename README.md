This is my own dotfiles config. I'll try to update them to be the best possible.

Current apps with dotfiles :
-neovim

To setup the files launch the script : 'setup.sh'
A backup will me made to keep your old config. It will be kept in ~/dotfiles_backup/{date}.
If you ever want to add your own dotfiles you just need to launch the 'setup.sh' again.
To restore your backup, launch the script 'backup_restore.sh' and give the date of the backup in format %Y-%m-%d\*%H:%M:%S
